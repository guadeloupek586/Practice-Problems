    *   Define the function factorial() that takes an integer argument and
    *   returns the factorial of that number.
    *   The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers
    *   less than or equal to that number.
    *   The factorial of 0 is 1.
    *   Hint: factorial can be calculated recursively.
